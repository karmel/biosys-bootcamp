A. There are 5001 distinct genes (with distinct Gene Descriptions).

B. The most correlated time-points for each cell-type are,
HL60: 0.5-hr and 4-hr
U937: 0.5-hr and 4-hr
NB4: 5.5-hr and 24-hr
Jurkat: 4-hr and 24-hr

C. The most similar cell types are NB4 and Jurkat based on mean and std.

D. Ten good candidates for machine calibration (by Gene Accession 
Number) are R89278_i, M54927, H88261, M95586_r_i, X73424_i, T50661, 
H85478, L20814, R41866_f, and M23668

E. 375 genes show two-fold higher expression after 24 hours for all cell 
types. See attached list for all of their Gene Accession Numbers.

F. 5544 genes show differential regulation between HL60 and U937 cells. 
See attached list for all of their Gene Accession Numbers.

G. There were several enriched ontology terms found using the DAVID 
ontology analyzer. See attached file for complete chart.
