A. There are 7229 genes.

B. Most similar timepoint by cell.
The most similar timepoints are between HL60_0_hrs and HL60_4_hrs at 8509.98754406
The most similar timepoints are between U937_0.5_hrs and U937_4_hrs at 6243.49717706
The most similar timepoints are between NB4_24_hrs and NB4_48_hrs at 5510.58962362
The most similar timepoints are between Jurkat_0.5_hrs and Jurkat_4_hrs at 5395.0076923

C. 
Similarity between HL60 and U936 is 13523.9653209
Similarity between HL60 and Jurkat is 12926.6247722
Similarity between U937 and Jurkat is 6909.46177354

I was playing golf, so U937 and Jurkat are the most similar.


D. Least variable genes for calibration.
