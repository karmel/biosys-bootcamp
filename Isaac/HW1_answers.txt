A.How many distinct genes are represented in the data set?
According to my procedure, 6575 genes. For getting this number, I took into
account that in the "Gene Accession Number" column there are some gene ids of
the form NN(...)NN and NN(...)NN_x, where NN(...)NN and NN(...)NN_x may be
isoforms of the same gene and should be counted only once.

B. Which two time points are the most highly correlated for each cell type?
For HL60, 0 and 4 hrs.
For U937, 0.5 and 4 hrs.
For NB4, 24 and 48 hrs.
For Jurkat, 0.5 and 4 hrs.

C. Which two cell types are the most similar?
NB4 and Jurkat. I consider similarity as the average of the correlation values
that are obtained when comparing each pair of cell types throughout the
different time points.

D.It is often useful to know which genes change very little across samples
for the sake of normalization or calibration. Based on this data set, what
are ten good candidates for genes to use to calibrate machinery or
analyses across all these samples?
For deciding which are the genes with the lowest amount of variation across the
different samples, I determine for a given gene, the gene's expression
coefficient of variation for all the cell types during time zero, and based on
that, the list with the genes that should vary very little is produced.
This is the list:
L32866
L13977
T66871
R85674
H15703
X62153
U04806_i
X80497
U27330
R22197

E. Do any genes show two-fold higher expression at 24 hours versus 0
hours for all four cell types? If so, which ones?
Yes. The ones that show an at least two-fold higher expression are
D16227, H16709, H24635, M15395, M26383, R32804, R70479_f, R70479_r_i,
T90632, U00115_f, U00672, U27467 and U30498.

F. Which genes are differentially regulated (at least two-fold higher or
lower) in HL60 cells as compared to U937 cells at 0 hours?
My program produces an output file with 3137 genes that are supposed to
satisfy this condition. This output file is attached.

G.Take the list of Gene Accession codes from (F), and run them through
the DAVID ontology analyzer. (at http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/
summary.jsp . These are GenBank Accession codes.) Are there any
enriched ontology terms?
Within the list submitted, the top 5 most enriched ontology terms are celular
processes, biological regulation, multicellular organismal process,
response to stimulus and developmental processes.
